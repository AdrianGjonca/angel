# Angel Development Tools
(_Angel DT_ or just _angel_ for short)

_Disclaimer: this project is still in experimental stages and not ready by any means for end-users_

Open source development tools and simple source-code libraries for aiding C programmers.

Angel DT is a package providing 3 parts:
* Angel BuilDer
* Angel PreCompiler
* Angel Lib

## Angel Builder
*(Only-just Functional: bound to change significantly)*
A simple tool for compiling multiple source-file C programs. Projects follow an ordered structure and are configured by a single JSON file. There everything from compiler flags to libraries can be adjusted. Designed to be a beginner friendly alternative to traditional Makefiles that may be overwhelming to beginers.

## Angel Precompiler
*(Very early development: don't bother using yet)*
A primitive 'extra' precompiler for C that adds a few extra shorthands to the language to prevent repetitive and unreadable code.

## Angel Library
*(Very early development: don't bother using yet)*
A library for C providing some useful features to the language.

# Angel Development Tools is still a massive WORK IN PROGRESS

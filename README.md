# Angel Development Tools
(_Angel DT_ or just _angel_ for short)

Open source development tools and simple source-code libraries for bringing C into the modern era.

Angel DT does not attempt to fundamentally change the C programming language like early C++ did. Instead angel offers a simple precompiler for a couple of useful features distinctly missing in C (namely: namespaces). It also offers a couple of key Libraries more String manipulation and safer memory managment.

NOTE: Angel DT does NOT - not likely ever will - make C object oriented. Angel just provides some ease of life features most modern programmers would appreciate.


# Angel Development Tools is still a massive WORK IN PROGRESS
